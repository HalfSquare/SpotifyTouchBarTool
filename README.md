# SpotifyTouchBarTool

This is a tool I made to constantly give me information about my Spotify session. The commands work even if a Youtube video is playing as long as Spotify is open the buttons will work unlike the default media buttons.

It displays the track name, artist of the track, duration of the track, the current time of the track and previous and next buttons.

## Getting Started

I have designed to the tool to work with BTT BetterTouchTool, this allows you to edit your Mac's touchbar. 

BTT: https://www.boastr.net/downloads
